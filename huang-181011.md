## Confounding Japanese Posters/Hashtags


I took the IDs of the top 50 posters from 07-13 to 10-09 (below) and found that 24/50 of them have their language set to Japanese, and 25/50 of them have their language set to English -- even though we're filtering for specific political hashtags likely to be related to US politics. With an analysis of top 1000 accounts, 357 are Japanese, 553 are in English. Some of us may have also noticed that there are a lot of Japanese hashtags cropping up at the top.

Interestingly enough, I went into a few of their profiles (milk_newsamor10, news_toma, etc... there are more) and realized that 1) they seem to essentially all be fan accounts for a J-pop band called NEWS 2) they're hashtagging a lot of tweets per post, in both Japanese and English and 3) they very often tag #NEWS and #BLUE which we may think are political, but aren't.

Given the amount of Japanese top posters using seemingly political hashtags I think we should change our filter to exclude users with their language set to Japanese. A second option is to reintroduce case-sensitivity for NEWS and BLUE specifically, since the Japanese posters seem to always capitalize it, but it's probably better to go with the first.
