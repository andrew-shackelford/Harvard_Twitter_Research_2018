## Getting midterm candidate data
Currently, we have a csv of midterm candidate names, states, districts, and chamber of Congress in the Google Drive. To do any meaningful political analysis, we need their party affiliation and whether they are incumbent. Today I am adding them to the csv by scraping Ballotpedia. The work can be found in `midterm_candidate_scraper.ipynb`.
The csv with all of the candidate data can now be found in the Google Drive [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tx9YmErC8eI2UD05hxWFNlGc1AY1lTKKxR9BISRN74Y/edit#gid=150906267)
