Twitter Handles
Compiled list of official Twitter handles for current representatives and senators.  May be interesting to look at their personal Twitter handles, too.  Similarly, may be interesting to look at Twitter handles of their opponents, which are not included in this list.  This spreadsheet is located in the shared drive under Research/Twitter Handles.xlxs.

Distribution of Tweets and Hashtags
Created histograms for tweet frequency (num tweets v num users with this number of tweets).  Had to use logarithmic scale to show on graph, since vast majority of people have <5 tweets per day.  Some accounts with over 1000 tweets.  This equates to about one tweet per minute...would be interesting to look more closely into these accounts.
Also created histograms for hashtag frequency (num occurences of hashtag v num hashtags that occur this many times).  Again, had to use logarithmic scale since most hashtags occur < 100 times.  Some very popular hashtags occur > 800K times.  Would be interesting to track popularity over time, too.  These histograms are located in the shared drive under Research/tweet_freq_DATE and Research/hashtag_freq_DATE.
