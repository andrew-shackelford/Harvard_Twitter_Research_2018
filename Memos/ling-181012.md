## Kavanaugh Confirmation
I analyzed the tweet text and hashtags from the day of the hearings (September 27, 2018).  I found that (as usual) there were much more conservative, pro-Kavanaugh tweets and hashtags than anti-Kavanaugh tweets and hashtags, both in counts of hashtag use and distinct hashtags used.  The full analysis can be found in the `kavanaugh_analysis.ipynb` IPython notebook. I categorized hashtags as pro or anti-Kavanaugh and then counted the number of pro and anti hashtags in individual tweets to determine if a tweet was pro or anti-Kavanaugh. I also kept counts of total hashtag use in addition to pro and anti-Kavanaugh tweet counts.
## Categorization of hashtags
During my analysis of the Kavanaugh-related hashtags, I also categorized hashtags not specific to Kavanaugh as liberal or conservative. More extensive work needs to be done on this to allow us to categorize tweets as liberal or conservative.
## Kavanaugh TODOs
It want to analyze how support/opposition changed over time, before and after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's story was released to the press, the hearings, Jeff Flake's hesitations, and the confirmation itself.
