## LDA Analysis

I did some topic modelling on our tweets from Oct 18th by running an LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) algorithm on it. I tried it with the text of the tweets, as well as only the hashtags of the tweets, using this unsupervised learning method to cluster them into 5 topics. This took an extremely long time on my computer, so I only did 10 iterations per analysis type.

I found that the LDA model on the hashtags are generally more coherent/understandable, with more distinct groupings of partisan hashtags, although there is some confusion. On the tweet text, the model seems to fit better (better perplexity score) but gives us less insights. I'd encourage people to take a look at the pyLDAviz visualizations, because they interestingly show the frequency of various hashtags as well as their importance to each topic cluster, as well as the distance between clusters. It seems that for both, the five clusters are loosely arranged in three groupings on the Intertopic Distance Map, with one being slightly more liberal -- but I think we'd have to train the model more times, on more varied data, to get more definitive conclusions.
