## Candidate Name Scraper
I wrote a scraper in `midterm_candidate_scraper.ipynb` to scrape [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018) for midterm candidates and write them to `candidate_names.csv`. It isn't 100% accurate because each state's Ballotpedia page is formatted slightly differently, and the scraper can't handle Ballotpedia's pages for some states like [New York](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_New_York,_2018) because they list fusion voting candidates, so we will have to manually get those names.  This is a good start, and will be especially useful if we want to get party and incumbent data. Right now, the scraper just gets district, name, and state for house of representatives candidates for the general election of November 6, 2018.  We should manually go through and correct any obvious mistakes (there were a lot, but not worth putting more time into debugging when we can just manually fix them), and fill in the missing states.
