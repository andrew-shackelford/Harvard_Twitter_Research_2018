## Predicting midterm elections
Today I converted the work in `midterm_predictions/midterm_predictions.ipynb` to a script called `predict_midterms.py` that Waldo will run tomorrow on his computer with all of the data. The script creates dictionaries with candidate handles as keys and a dictionary with the numbers of liberal, conservative, and neutral tweets from unique users that mention them. I just realized while writing this that we might be overcounting tweets that mention multiple people in different handle lists (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B). I'll fix this tomorrow.
