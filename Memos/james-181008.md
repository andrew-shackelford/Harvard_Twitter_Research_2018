## Candidate handles

Emma, Sarah and I determined that it would be interesting to do some analysis of of midterm candidates. The first step is necessarily gathering the handles and user profiles of the midterm election candidates.

**Sources**
Sarah and Emma have found sources for the midterm election candidate names. Emma found and compiled a list of all Senate candidates, and Sarah did some manual work and is looking into the possibility of scraping House candidates due to volume. The names we have so far can be found in "Midterm Candidates" on the drive, and statically in ConfigFiles/candidateNames.txt.

**Tweepy Handles**
I used tweepy to search Twitter for the names of the candidates. My work is built upon previous work in twitter_hashtag_filter.py, but rather than using the tweepy Stream functionality, I use tweepy's search_users to iterate through each candidates name. I filter out non-verified users and assume the first result to be the desired user object. For now, I'm storing all the information from the user profile object returned from the Twitter API in a json file.

**Testing:**

python twitter_user_handles.py ConfigFiles/haileyKeysCandidates.txt

See output in midterms/all_candidates.json
