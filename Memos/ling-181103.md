Today Hailey, Nari, Saffron, Sarah, Amy, and I met to work on research. Hailey, Saffron, and I wrote code to count the number of conservative and liberal tweets per candidate, which we will hopefully run on Monday to make predictions by Tuesday.  I'm a little worried about using hashtags as the basis of political support because most of the tweets mentioning candidates don't include hashtags, so we're only really analyzing a very small sample of the activity around these candidates on Twitter.  Hailey is working on tracking the user_id to try to determine the impact of social influence by isolating unique people.
