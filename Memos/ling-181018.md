## Continuing Kavanaugh analysis
My goal is to write a script that will download the json data from the Google Drive, get the relevant historical tweets involving Kavanaugh, store relevant information, and delete the data. Hopefully this script will be useful to others who need to get historical Twitter data to analyze trends over time.
