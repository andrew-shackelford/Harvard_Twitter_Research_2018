## Top hashtags
I noticed that a lot of the top hashtags are repeats (e.g. "NEWS", "news", and "News"). We should change the code that creates the dictionaries to eliminate duplicates by making the hashtags case-insensitive before adding to the counts.

I aggregated the counts for hashtags from the start of data collection on 2018-07-13 to 2018-09-19 and created a list of hashtags that are not in our list of hashtags being filtered, in descending order of total counts.  Both the full list and the top 1000 are in the Google Drive. We can manually sort them into political and decide whether to add them to our filter.

I started filtering down the list of hashtags to the politically relevant ones. I've gone through to the first 100 lines of "hashtags_to_add.txt".
