## Top hashtags
I noticed that a lot of the top hashtags are repeats (e.g. "NEWS", "news", and "News"). We should change the code that creates the dictionaries to eliminate duplicates by making the hashtags case-insensitive before adding to the counts.

I'm looking at the top hashtags found in these tweets that are not already being tracked, and then manually sort them to be added to our tracked hashtags with approval.
