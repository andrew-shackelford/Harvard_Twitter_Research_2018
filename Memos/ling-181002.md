## Top hashtags
I noticed that a lot of the top hashtags are repeats (e.g. "NEWS", "news", and "News"). We should change the code that creates the dictionaries to eliminate duplicates by making the hashtags case-insensitive before adding to the counts.

I looked at the top 1000 hashtags found in these tweets from 09-19-2018 that are not already being tracked, and then uploaded them as a text file to the Google Drive as "top_1000_hashtags_not_in_political_hashtags_2018_09-19.txt" so we can manually sort them into political and decide whether to add them to our filter.

Optimally, I should write this to do it for all of the hashtag count dictionaries.
